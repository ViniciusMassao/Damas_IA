## Motivation
I decided to create checkers in Python using Pygame to help increase my knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming. I've uploaded a YouTube video of my project conclusion [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWl2LBISMug), where I talk about what I learned from the project and how I felt about the project after completing it.

This the first programming project I have ever completed entirely on my own and I must admit that it was much more challenging than the "follow along tutorial projects" that I'm used to. I found this project to be considerably more productive in furthering my knowledge of python and object-oriented programming because I was forced to create my own solutions to problems I encountered, which really helped engrain valuable programming concepts into my mind.


## Details

### Requirements
- python 3+
- pygame 1.9.5

### How to play 
Simply download the project and run the "checkers.py" file.

### Miscellaneous
- I did not implement forced jumping because I personally found it to make the game less enjoyable.
- This project taught me a lot. I defintely would have done things a lot different if I we're to start all over again. Sadly, I didn't know about classes before starting this project, which led to a lot of spaghetti code. The first thing I would done differently would be to implement classes so that my code would be a lot more organized and understandable not only for myself but also for others. I also would split the project into three separate modules board, pieces and game.
- Idea for possible YouTube series. I noticed that there aren't many Pygame projects or python projects out there on YouTube currently that I find personally interesting (no offense to current YouTubers) so I'm thinking about making these projects somewhat of a series of YouTube where I will either post a short edited video where I walkthrough creating the project with the viewer or uploading a completing unedited stream of me creating the project from scratch or both.
